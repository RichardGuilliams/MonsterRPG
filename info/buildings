Buildings will be able to do a variety of actions such as periodically generating resources, crafting, breeding and fusions. 
Some will serve as a gate between players to allow trading, buying and selling of goods and monsters.
Most buildings will have some kind of dungeon that may even change based on which monster is assigned as the leader.
EX: The mine will primarily act as a cave with average cave monsters in each level, however, if a demon is the leader of the mine, the 
cave will instead be a pit of the underworld and various daemons will be found. As well, a giant spider or Arachne as the leader will turn the 
cave into a spider nest. Converting all monsters into various types of spiders.

As well, the production of buildings can change based on the leader as well
ex: a mine will primarily produce metal and stone, however with a mystic golem assigned as the leader, the mine will begin producing
enchanted gems along with its regular query.
